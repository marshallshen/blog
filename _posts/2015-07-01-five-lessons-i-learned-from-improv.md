I started taking comedy improv classes at [Second City theater](http://www.secondcity.com/) since August 2014. It's almost been a year since I met my improv group. I'm amazed by how improv has changed all of us, and I would like to share some lessons I learned during the past year.

### Lesson One: It's all about listening.
In improv, a great moment on stage comes out of genuine reactions in a scene. If the actors immerse themselves in developing story is on stage, the audience is more likely to enjoy the story. Developing story usually involves multiple actors building plots together, therefore listening and observing each other is key to building a great story plot.

In life,  when we talk about team success, we talk about communications and productivity of a whole team. Great communications come out of every team member being an attentive listener. Great productivity comes out of every team member taking actions via great communications.

### Lesson Two: Be in the moment
In improv, the only interesting scene on stage is the scene that is **happening now**. Good improvisers dig deeper on what is happening right now, rather than talking or acting about something in the future.

In life, we tend to fret about future without realizing that we may miss what is happening now. From the perspective of optimizing life productivity, worrying about future is purely counter-productive. Even if some great challenge lies ahead,  the best we can do is to focus on what we can do now. Being in the moment gives us the best chance to tackle a future challenge in our fullest potential.

### Lesson Three: Energy is contagious
In improv, the energy level of one improviser affects that of another improviser on stage. If it's a two people scene at a cocktail party, one actor acts with extreme enthusiasm, the other actor is more likely to be super enthusiastic as well.

In life, our energy levels (and perception of the world for that matter) are constantly affected by our friends and family. An ancient Chinese quote "近朱者赤，近墨者黑." says "Surrounded by the good, you are more likely to be good. Surrounded by the evil, you are more likely to be evil." We should be aware of the energy we bring to our friends and family, and vice versa.

### Lesson Four: Embrace change
In improv, improvisers can never predict how a scene is going to start, and how a scene is going to develop. The best an improviser can do is to welcome any unexpected story twist. Whenever someone gives an idea on stage, other improvisers should "yes-and" the idea, and they start to build stories by embracing each other's choices.

In life, we can never predict what exactly are going to happen in the future. Whenever an unexpected change takes place, the best thing we can do is to acknowledge the change and do our best based on the change.

### Lesson Five: Love the Audience
In improv, every moment on stage is about the audience - they are people who investment their time and money to see an improv show. Great improvisers show gratefulness to the decisions of the audience, and they improvise every moment out of love and respect to the audience. Naturally, that spirit of love and respect facilitates a great show.

In life, the world is our audience, and we have the resource of our lifetime, a valuable and limited resource. Therefore, we should be grateful for every moment when we are well and alive, and we should spend our every moment with love and respect to the world.

## Conclusion
Over the past year, not only have I learned great ideas about comedy, but some great ideas about life as well. Most of those ideas are connected. As many people have experienced, theater is reflection of life.
