With a smart phone, a middle school girl from Shanghai in 2015 has more knowledge access than a Hardvard student in 1995. Most Americans, and increasing amout of people around the world, have instant access to knowledge that was only available for the elite. However, the structure of traditional education doesn't expect this change: one core foundation of eduction is **access to knowledge**. Many academic institutions hold their grand libraries as source of [pride and identity](http://www.collegerank.net/amazing-college-libraries). Indeed, Access to knowledge breeds great mind, and academic instituions thrive around abundance of academic resources.

The Internet is changing the way we educate and get educated. The trend's speaking itself: universities such as Standford are making their courses available [online](http://online.stanford.edu/) for free; startups such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) has millions of students worldwide studying various subjects, and I just finished my graduate degree mostly online.

What does this do to our traditional education in institution? How will online education change the way we learn? I have quite experience with online education and I write about my opinions based on experience. Specifically, I will address the following questions:

  1. What I've learned from pursuing online degree?
  2. What are some problems in education startups such as Coursera?
  3. How can we individuals benefit from online education?

## Person Journey with Online Degrees
Recently, I graduated with a Master degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. I finished my degree part time and mostly online while working full time in Chicago. As a leading institution who utilizes the power of Internet, Columbia University has a program called [Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) that allows students around the world to pursue master degrees in engineering. Part-time, off-campus students must finish the same academic requirements as full-time, on-campus students. To make programs flexible, Columbia records every lecture with great equipments, the school also assign TAs who are solely responsible for part-time students. In addition, Columbia also provides online discussion forums and virtual office hours to keep students and faculty engaged.

It took me two years to finish my master degree. Looking back I really appreciate avalue the experience. As challenging as it was, the program provided serveral main benefits.

First, **it gives me financial feasibility to work through a master**. As I've been working off-time, I was able to pay off my intuition using my own income. Being able to graduate from a great institution debt-free is a big-win for future career and personal life.

Second, **the program makes efforts to make me feel on campus**. During my last semester, I participated in a data privacy research within Columbia Computer Science department. Although I was remote, the Columbia helped set me up with professors and researchers so that I could collaborate them as much as possible. After the semester of research, I was truly glad with what I learned and the friendship I formed with the research team.

Third, **great institutions have great Alumni network**. Having an Ivy League network benefits one's career. When I went to my graduation ceremony in New York, for example, I was impressed by a popular presence of Columbia alumnis in the city, and I am very happy that I can be part of that network.

Of course, pursuing online degrees has its shortcomings, specifically lack of study time and lack of physical presence. There were times where I wish I've mastered certain topics / subjects better; there were times when I wish I had direct, instant conversation with class faculties; there were times when I left behind the progress of a class and struggled to catch up. In addition, the devices set up are not 100% error-free: recording were occasionally problematic, communications between TAs and remote students were unclear.

From my point of view as a student, getting a master degree is a truly worthwhile experience. From an institution point of view, online degree makes financial sense: most online degree students pay full amount of tuition, and they need less resources. For an instituion like Columbia, with great equipment and tools, online education program is a lucrative business.

## Startups of Education
"Learn any valuable skill online" has been possible but difficult for the past decade - possible because of Internet but difficult because of lack of coherent study materials for a given subject. The gap between the "possible" and "difficult" inspires a new set of education companies such as Coursera and EdX. The genius of these companies is **borrowing existing structures from academic institutions**. Partnership with academic institutions serves the foundation of these companies' success. Furthermore, online forums built for online students create a unique space for interaction among students. A student from Paris can raise a question that can be readily answered by another student from Tokyo.

One big problem of online education is **lack of research engagement with faculties**. Speaking from my own experience, one of the most beneficial lessons I learned are from conducting research with faculty members - to explore an unknown subjects together, to discuss and debate different possibilties around a subject. **Being able to conduct experiment on a subject independently** is a key skill for any student. It's a **proactive** pursuit of knowledge rather than **passive interpretation** of knowledge. Frankly, on the scale of an online class, which may have thousands of students enrolled, it's impossible to give students such opportunities. It would be interesting to see how academic research evolves with the rapid change of online education (some effort began to emerge, see [open science project](http://www.openscience.org/blog/)).

## Life Long Learning
Looking back on my online degree experience, what I'm grateful the most is that by studying late at night over and over, gradually **I form a habit of learning**. Rather than sitting on couch watching TV after work, I find myself read books, learn new technology, or do other physical activities.

What excites me the most about the movement of online education is how **it can enforce the habit of life-long learning**: we now have access of knowledge within the reach of our fingertips, ranging from vast different subjects, organized by academic institutions. To many people who crave to try new things, learn new subjects, online education is an infinite playground. The question is: how do we use these resources to benefit us?

Life is built on a collection of habits, and learning is a habit. I treat online education as a way to enforce my habit of learning: taking one class I'm interested in, set up schedule for that class, make it part of my routine, and evaluate what works and what doesn't. In addition, online forum provides a great way to seek support: I'm very impressed by friendly ambience around discussion forums on Coursera, the level of respect each of us show around peers, sometimes anonymously.


## Conclusion: Natural Aristocracy
Thomas Jefferson often wrote about the need to create a "natural aristocracy". He believed that all societies inevitably have elites: someone has to be on top. But America's elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. In his mind, the poor and the rich had to have equal access to a good education. He wrote:

> The whole people must take upon themselves the education of whole people.. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it.

The online education has brought Jefferson's idea closer to reality. Essentially, they are free for anyone who has Internet acess. How will online education evolve to help bridge inequalities in society? What will generations after generations be impacted by online education? How will online education change how we perceive and approach knowledge?

Although many questions are unanswered, one thing is certain: it's going to be an amazing ride.
