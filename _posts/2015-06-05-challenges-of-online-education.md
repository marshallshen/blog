## Rethink education

The paradigm of education has shfited. With a smart phone, a middle school girl from Shanghai in 2015 has more knowledge access than a Harvard student in 1995. In traditional eduction, knowledge can only be accessed by a few people within academic institutions. Nowadays, most knowldge are instantly available to most people around the world. The fundamental **limited access to knowledge** has changed, therefore the concept of eduction needs to change.

I experience this change of education myself. Recently, I graduated with a Master degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. I finished my degree mostly online as a part-time student while working full time in Chicago. As a leading institution, Columbia University has a program called [Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) that allows students around the world to pursue master degrees in engineering. Off-campus students must finish the same academic requirements as on-campus, full-time students. To make programs flexible, Columbia records every lecture with great equipment, the school also assign teaching assistants who are solely responsible for part-time students. Also, Columbia provides online discussion forums and virtual office hours to keep students and faculty engaged.

#### Yay Online Degree!

Getting an online Master Degree is a positive experience. There are several major benefits.

First, **it gives me financial feasibility to finish a master program**. ^I don't have to pay the cost of living in New York City^. As I've been working full-time, I was able to pay off my tuition using my income. Being able to graduate from a great institution with no debt is a big win for future career and personal pursuit.

Second, **the program strives to make off-campus students feel on campus**. During my last semester, I participated in a data privacy research with Computer Science department. Although I was remote, the school arranged me with professors and researchers so that I could collaborate them as much as possible. After a semester of research, I learned a lot about issues around digital data privacy. Also, I had great pleasure working with people on campus and formed a friendship with the research team. ^I didn't miss out on being on campus^

Third, **Columbia University have great Alumni network**. When I went to my graduation ceremony in New York, I was impressed by a popular presence of Columbia alumni in the city, and I am very happy that I can be part of that network.

#### Err Online Degree..

Getting an online Master Degree has its own drawbacks.

Due to my part-time basis, my academic perform got affected due to the lack of study time and physical presence. There were times when I wish I mastered certain subjects better; when I wish I had a direct conversation with faculties; when I left behind of a class and struggled to catch up. Also, recording devices were occasionally problematic, and communications between faculties and students were sometimes unclear.

Online degree also only offers limited resources with faculties on campus. ^TODO: elaborate more^.

Study online doesn't offer the complete feeling of being campus. ^TODO: aht^

## Life-long learning

^Getting an online degree forms my habit of life-long learning. After getting the degree I start to explore different methods of online education. I will write another blog post describing my experience with Coursera, an online education startup.^

Thomas Jefferson often wrote about the need to create a "natural aristocracy". He believed that all societies inevitably have elites: someone has to be on top. But America's elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. In his mind, the poor and the rich had to have equal access to a good education. He wrote:

> The whole people must take upon themselves the education of whole people.. There should not be a district of a one-mile square, without a school in it.

Online education has brought Jefferson's idea closer to reality. Essentially, they are free for anyone who has Internet access. ^remove questions, make personal statement^.

How will online education evolve to help bridge inequalities in society? What will generations after generations be impacted by online education? How will online education change how we perceive and approach knowledge?
