Think about this subtle yet profound scenario: with a smart phone, a middle school girl from Shanghai in 2015 has more knowledge access than a Hardvard student in 1995. Most Americans, and increasing amout of people around the world, have instant access to knowledge that was only available for the elite. Think about structure of our traditional education: one core foundation of eduction is **access to knowledge**. Many academic institutions hold their grand libraries as source of [pride and identity](http://www.collegerank.net/amazing-college-libraries). Indeed, Access to knowledge breeds great minds, and rationally academic instituions thrive around abundance of academic resources.

Now that Internet has fundamentally changed the way people access information, We also need to re-evaluate the traditional way of education (read Daphne Koller, cofounder of Coursera, on [her thoughts](http://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-koller-on-the-future-of-online-education-1433532321) of the Future of Online Education).

The trend speaks itself: institutions such as Standford makes its courses available [online](http://online.stanford.edu/); education startups such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) has millions of students worldwide studying various subjects, just to name a few. What does this do to our traditional education in institution? How will online education change the way we learn? In this blogpost, I will write about my own experience of online education, with intention to address the following questions:

  1. What does online education benefit / harm academic institutions?
  2. What are some pros and cons of online education tools such as Coursera?
  3. How can we individuals benefit from online education?

## Online Education for Academic Institutions
Recently, I graduated with a Master degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. I finished my degree part time and mostly online while working full time in Chicago. As a leading institution that utilizes the power of Internet, Columbia University has a program called [Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) that allows students around the world to pursue master degrees in engineering. Part-time, off-campus students must finish the same academic requirements as full-time, on-campus students. To make programs flexible, Columbia records every single lecture with great equipments, they also assign TAs who are solely responsible to part-time students. In addition, Columbia also provides a set of tools such as Pizza and Canvas, both are course discussion and assistance software, to help students communicate with faculties as seamlessly as possible.

It took me two years to finish my master degree. Looking back I really appreciate the experience. From my perspective, I am grateful that I have the option to continue school while working full-time. As challenging as it was, I was able to pay off my intuition using my own income. Financially, the part-time program puts me in a great position.

Second, despite the fact I'm off-campus, the Columbia Video Network program has provided great resources to make me feel "on campus". During my last semester, I was able to be part of data privacy research team in Columbia Computer Science department. I use Google hangout to have online meetings with the team, and occassionally I'd fly out to campus to have longer discussions. I made friends and learned from professors, almost as if I'm an on-campus student.

From institution's perspective, offering online degrees makes sense economically: off-campus students often pay full tuition, which means that a part-time student who finishes his/her degree generates $60,000 revenue to the instituition, just tuition alone. This is good money.

Inevitably, not being in a physical classroom, in addition to having less time to study, affects my academic performance: there were times where I wish I've mastered certain topics / subjects better; there were times when I wish I can have direct, instant conversation with class faculties; there were times when I left behind the progress of a class and struggled to catch up. In addition, the devices set up are not 100% error-free: recording sometimes can be problematic, communications between TAs and remote students can be unclear.

Overall, I had a great experience in pursuing a master degree from Columbia University with help of online education. Is it worth the time and money? It depends - based on the way I current value personal education, career and finance, it is worth my time and money: first, I am more knowledgable on different subjects around Computer Science after finishing my master program (Computer Security, Natural Language Processing, etc.); second, part-time program allows me to finish an expensive program debt-free; third, getting a master degree from a prestigious instituion naturally spans my career network; fourth, being an immigrant worker in the United States, having an advanced degree helps me in [pursuing a permanent residency in the United States](http://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2).

## Emergence of online education companies
"Learn any valuable skill online" has been possible but difficult for the past decade: possible because of Internet but difficult because of lack of coherent study materials for a given subject. The gap between the "possible" and "difficult" inspires a new set of education companies such as Coursera and EdX. The genius of these companies is **borrowing existing structures from academic institutions**. Partnership with academic institutions is the foundation of these companies' resources. Furthermore, online forums built for online students create a unique space for interaction among students. So a student from Paris can raise a question that can be readily answered by another student from Tokyo.

Yet online education companies face the same challenge as traditional institutions: high dropout rate. The majority online students stopped the program half-way, some students registered in a program but never actually take the class. Furthermore, the lack of physical presence posts another challenge: how will lack of physical interaction with peers and faculties affect the qualities of learning? Measuring such effect is difficult because there's no metrics that indicate how much a student actually learned from class.

To me, the biggest problem of online education is **lack of research engagement with faculties**. Speaking from my own experience, one of the most beneficial lessones I learned are from conducting research with faculty members - to explore an unknown subjects together, to discuss and debate different possibilties around a subject. **Being able to conduct experiment on a subject independently** is a key skill for any student. It's a **proactive** pursuit of knowledge rather than **passive interpretation** of knowledge. Frankly, on the scale of an online class, which may have thousands of students enrolled, it's impossible to give students such opportunities. It would be interesting to see how academic research evolves with the rapid change of online education (some effort began to emerge, see [open science project](http://www.openscience.org/blog/)).

## Habits of Life-long Learning
What excites me the most about the movement of online education is how **it can enforce the habit of life-long learning**: we now have access of knowledge, ranging from vast different subjects, organized by academic institutions, are within the reach of our fingertips. To many people who crave to try new things, learn new subjects, this is an infinite playground. The question is: how do we use these resources to benefit us?

Life is a collection of habits, and learning is a habit. I treat online education as a way to enforce my habit of learning: taking one class I'm interested in, set up schedule for that class, make it part of my routine, and evaluate what works and what doesn't. In addition, online forum provides a great way to seek support: I'm very impressed by friendly ambience around discussion forums on Coursera, the level of respect each of us show around peers, sometimes anonymously.


## Conclusion: Natural Aristocracy
Thomas Jefferson often wrote about the need to create a "natural aristocracy". He believed that all societies inevitably have elites: someone has to be on top. But America's elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. In his mind, the poor and the rich had to have equal access to a good education. He wrote:

> The whole people must take upon themselves the education of whole people.. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it.

The online education has brought Jefferson's idea closer to reality. Essentially, they are free for anyone who has Internet acess. How will online education evolve to help bridge inequalities in society? What will generations after generations be impacted by online education? How will online education change how we perceive and approach knowledge?

Although many questions are unanswered, one thing is certain: it's going to be an amazing ride.
