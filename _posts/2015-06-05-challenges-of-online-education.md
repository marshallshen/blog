With a smart phone, a middle school girl from Shanghai in 2015 has more knowledge access than a Harvard student in 1995. Most Americans and increasing amount of people around the world have instant access to knowledge that was only available for the elite. However, the structure of traditional education doesn't expect this change: one core foundation of education is **access to knowledge**. Many academic institutions hold their grand libraries as a source of [pride and identity](http://www.collegerank.net/amazing-college-libraries). Indeed, Access to knowledge breeds great mind, and academic institutions thrive around an abundance of academic resources.

The Internet is changing the way we educate and get educated. The trend's speaking itself: universities such as Standford are making their courses available [online](http://online.stanford.edu/) for free; startups such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) has millions of students worldwide studying various subjects, and I just finished my graduate degree mostly online.

What does this mean for our traditional education in an institution? How will online education change the way we learn? I will use my experience with online education to express my opinions. Specifically, I will address the following questions:

  1. What have I learned from pursuing an online degree?
  2. What are some problems in education startups such as Coursera?
  3. How can we individuals benefit from online education?

## Pursue an Online Degree
Recently, I graduated with a Master degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. I finished my degree mostly online as a part-time student while working full time in Chicago. As a leading institution, Columbia University has a program called [Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) that allows students around the world to pursue master degrees in engineering. Off-campus students must finish the same academic requirements as on-campus, full-time students. To make programs flexible, Columbia records every lecture with great equipment, the school also assign teaching assistants who are solely responsible for part-time students. Also, Columbia provides online discussion forums and virtual office hours to keep students and faculty engaged.

It took me two years to finish my master degree. As challenging as it was, the program provided several main benefits.

First, **it gives me financial feasibility to finish a master program**. As I've been working full-time, I was able to pay off my tuition using my income. Being able to graduate from a great institution with no debt is a big win for future career and personal pursuit.

Second, **the program strives to make off-campus students feel on campus**. During my last semester, I participated in a data privacy research with Computer Science department. Although I was remote, the school arranged me with professors and researchers so that I could collaborate them as much as possible. After a semester of research, I learned a lot about issues around digital data privacy. Also, I had great pleasure working with people on campus and formed a friendship with the research team.

Third, **great institutions have great Alumni network**. When I went to my graduation ceremony in New York, I was impressed by a popular presence of Columbia alumni in the city, and I am very happy that I can be part of that network.

Of course, pursuing online degrees has its drawbacks, specifically the lack of study time and physical presence. There were times when I wish I mastered certain subjects better; when I wish I had a direct conversation with faculties; when I left behind of a class and struggled to catch up. Also, recording devices were occasionally problematic, and communications between faculties and students were sometimes unclear.

From my point of view as a student, getting an online master degree is worthwhile. From an institution point of view, an online degree program is a great revenue stream - the majority of online students pay a full amount of tuition. As more students plan to pursue online degrees, the online education program from a prestigious institution is a lucrative business.

## Online Education Startups
"Learn any skill online" has been possible but difficult for the past decade. It's possible because of a great amount of information on the Internet, but it's difficult because the information lacks structures present in physical institutions. The gap between the "possible" and "difficult" inspires a new set of education companies such as Coursera and EdX. The genius of these companies is **borrowing existing structures from academic institutions**. A partnership with academic institutions provides structures to academic information online. Furthermore, online forums built for online students create a unique space for interaction among students. A student from Paris can raise a question that can be readily answered by another student from Tokyo.

However, one big problem of online education is **the lack of research engagement with faculties**. Some of my most beneficial lessons were from conducting research with school faculties - to explore unknown subjects together, to discuss and debate different possibilities around a subject. Being able to conduct an experiment on a subject independently is a key skill for any student. It's a proactive pursuit of knowledge rather than passive interpretation of knowledge. Frankly, because thousands of students enroll in online classes, it's impossible to give students such opportunities. It would be interesting to see how academic research evolves with the rapid change of online education (some effort began to emerge, see [open science project](http://www.openscience.org/blog/)).

## Life Long Learning
Looking back on my online degree experience, what I'm grateful the most is the learning habit I formed. By studying late at night over and over, **I acquired extra stamina for learning after work**. Rather than switching to "relax and do nothing" mode after work, I find myself read books, learn new technology, or do other physical activities.

**Online education can enforce the habit of life-long learning**: we now have access of knowledge within the reach of our fingertips, ranging from vast different subjects, organized by academic institutions. To many people who try to learn new things, online education is an infinite playground. The structures within those online education programs allow people to learn at their pace.

Also, learning communities have been thriving on the Internet. Online discussion forums provide a great way to seek support. I'm very impressed by the friendly ambiance of discussion forums on Coursera, students around the world, barely know each other, contribute and share knowledge in the forum. It demonstrates the power of online community, the collaborative culture around online education.

Life is built on a collection of habits, and learning is a habit. To me, online education is a way to enforce my habit of learning. The question is: how do we use online education to benefit us in our lifetime?


## Conclusion: Natural Aristocracy
Thomas Jefferson often wrote about the need to create a "natural aristocracy". He believed that all societies inevitably have elites: someone has to be on top. But America's elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. In his mind, the poor and the rich had to have equal access to a good education. He wrote:

> The whole people must take upon themselves the education of whole people.. There should not be a district of a one-mile square, without a school in it.

The online education has brought Jefferson's idea closer to reality. Essentially, they are free for anyone who has Internet access. How will online education evolve to help bridge inequalities in society? What will generations after generations be impacted by online education? How will online education change how we perceive and approach knowledge?

Although many questions are unanswered, one thing is certain: it's going to be an amazing ride.
