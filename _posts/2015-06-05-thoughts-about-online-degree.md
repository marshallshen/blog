## Rethink Education

The paradigm of education has shifted. With a smart phone, a middle school girl from Shanghai in 2015 has more knowledge access than a Harvard student in 1995. In traditional education, knowledge can only be accessed by a few people within academic institutions. Nowadays, most knowledge is instantly available to most people around the world. The fundamental **limited access to knowledge** has changed. Therefore, the concept of education needs to change.

I experience this change of education myself. Recently, I graduated with a Master degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. I finished my degree mostly online as a part-time student while working full time in Chicago. As a leading institution, Columbia University has a program called [Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) that allows students around the world to pursue master degrees in engineering. Off-campus students must finish the same academic requirements as on-campus, full-time students. To make programs flexible, Columbia records every lecture with great equipment, the school also assign teaching assistants who are solely responsible for part-time students. Also, Columbia provides online discussion forums and virtual office hours to keep students and faculty engaged.

#### Pros of Online Degree

Getting an online Master Degree is a positive experience. There are several major benefits.

First, **it gives me financial feasibility to finish a master program**. Columbia online degree program allowed me to live outside of New York City, so I avoided paying a premium price for living in the city. Also, the program gives me the flexibility to have a full-time job. I used my income to pay off my intuition and finished the entire program debt-free.

Second, **I participated in many on-campus activities despite that I was off-campus**. In my last semester, I conducted research with Computer Science department. The school set me up with professors and researchers. The Computer Science department provided information on research options in different areas. After I had chosen a research team to work with, the department offered academic credits for the project I took on. I joined [XRay](http://xray.cs.columbia.edu), a data privacy research that focused on how user information is being exploited by web companies. I learned a lot about issues around digital data privacy. Also, I had great pleasure working with people on campus and formed a friendship with the research team.

Third, **Columbia University have great Alumni network**. When I went to my graduation ceremony in New York, I was impressed by a popular presence of Columbia alumni in the city, and I am very happy that I can be part of that network. In the long run, having the experience of great education expands my connections who share a similar experience.

#### Cons of Online Degree

Getting an online Master Degree has its drawbacks.

First, **my academic performance was affected due to the lack of study time and physical presence**. Juggling between work and study is challenging, and having not enough time to study affected how much material I could digest out of a class. Occasionally, I found myself behind class schedules and rushed to catch up. To enhance my learning, I had to take time off from work, sometimes two to three days, to understand course material, and finish course projects.

Second, **online study experience can't replace on-campus experience**. A big part of college is being physically together with classmates, struggling through same classes, sharing similar student life experience, and forming a long-term friendship. Although I tried to engage with professors and students as much as possible, the experience wasn't the same. Occasionally I flew to the campus and stayed for a few days. It was clear to me that I experienced more about student life by **physically being there**. The energetic vibe of campus life was vivid, the students and professors I worked with were interesting, and the scene of sleepless New York City impressed me. Being physically on campus gave me a sense of what Columbia University's culture, which was impossible for me to experience by only studying online.

Third, **online degrees don't require  academic research**. Many online degree programs offer courses to complete, but most of them don't require students to conduct independent research with professors. In my opinion, a critical skill to learn in graduate school is **the ability to conduct research**. Graduate programs teach people to be disciplined scholars so that they can explore new knowledge by themselves. Exploring new knowledge requires the ability to asking right questions, modeling abstract problems, and designing concrete experiments, to make name a few. We can't acquire those skills by just taking classes.

## Life-long learning

I finished my online degree with joys and tears, but learning doesn't stop there.

Learning is a life-long quest. Retrospectively, I most appreciate the learning habits I formed by finishing my online degree. Naturally, I found myself seek new subjects to learn through online education programs such as Coursera and edX. I am extremely excited about the potential of these Ed tech companies. They are making elite education more accessible to everyone.

Thomas Jefferson often wrote about the need to create a "natural aristocracy". He believed that all societies inevitably have elites: someone has to be on top. But America's elite should come from finding the best and brightest and educating them well. In his mind, the poor and the rich had to have equal access to a good education. He wrote:

> The whole people must take upon themselves the education of whole people.. There should not be a district of a one-mile square, without a school in it.

Online education has brought Jefferson's idea closer to reality. Essentially, they are free for anyone who has Internet access. I'm very excited how online education can provide people across the world better chance to succeed in life.
