Being in the startup world for the past year opened my eyes. As a reflection of my recent experience, the blog post shares my thoughts on this important question:

 > What we talk about when we talk about startup?

## Build for a Purpose
"Why the startup" is the question to address. A clear WHY motivates the company to tackle difficult challenges. A clear WHY attracts right people on the bus. A clear WHY brings loyalty from customers. 

Looking at most successful companies in history, we realize that people are loyal to why the company exists, not just what it offers. Besides classic case study of Victory such as Apple or Facebook, my current favorite example for this is SoulCycle. As a fanatic SoulCycle supporter, the spirit of "riding as a community" attracts me to go back over and over. I bought into "what SoulCycle represents" rather than "what SoulCycle can offer" (frankly, I can ride bikes with music anywhere!). 

## The joy of Highs and Lows

If you're in a startup, then you will fail, and you will learn.

Business involves complex human activity. Business is unpredictable and fast-changing. Business demands many things to go right to hit a small win. 

We know we are going to try different things, we know we are going to fail, and we know that, with a strong sense of WHY we embarked on the journey of this startup, we will rise back standing, smarter and stronger.

Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, put it nicely:

> When you are eighty years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are out choices.

We made a deliberate choice of venturing into the unknowns. We can perceive the inevitable highs and lows as part of our meaningful journey. In the end, life is too short for not doing something meaningful.

## YES AND the Ensemble
Startup aside, I have had the privilege of performing improvised comedy with a group of talented artists. Improv Comedy taught me a great deal on how to run  business. 

For the past few months, I’ve been performing as a musical improviser at Chicago iO theater on Monday nights. Acting on stage is a thrilling experience. I always feel the adrenaline rush of facing the limelight and showing my theatrical self to an audience. As improvisers, we take one suggestion from the audience, and we build stories and characters on the spot. We act out some most eccentric characters and create some most unexpected stories right on the spot. We, and hopefully the audience, are so immersed in the art form that 30 minutes feel like a few seconds.

During my recent show, something magical happened. The routine started as usual: we warmed up our voices, played some improv games, and lined up behind the stage curtains ready for the real show. Right before we hit the stage, I looked at my fellow improvisers and tried to sync up with their excitement: Erika was doing some hippie 90s bud-shaking dance, BJ was walking like a dwarf with his neck stuck out, and Chris had some wild blue dance moves going on. While I was doing my regular chicken dance with inconsistent hand clapping, a strong sense of gratitude flooded inside. I realized how lucky I am to play with such an incredible group, how lucky I am to share a moment of alternative reality with them, and how lucky I am to be on a journey of fun together with these crazy kids.

As we hit the stage, that sense of gratitude changed the way I perform. I completely focused on how to build great scenes by paying attention to the group. There is no sense of “me”, only the sense of “us”. That gratitude leads to group-mind, and that group-mind leads to playfulness and incredible energy.

Business is like an improv show. The market is the audience, and the audience (i.e. the market) throws out a suggestion, and the ensemble (i.e. the company staff) work with each other to create a show (i.e. startup). Neither the audience nor the ensemble knows what to expect, yet the show goes on, and in the end, it's either a stellar show, or not.

Much like the theatrical show, the best thing to do for an ensemble is to form group-mind. Everybody within the startup understands the WHY and support each other. A journey of a successful startup must be a journey of "YES AND".
