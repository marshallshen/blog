Being in the start up world for the past year opened my eyes. As a reflection of my recent experience, the blogpost shares my thoughts on this important question:

 > What we talk about when we talk about startup?

## The passion to build something for a purpose

The first question I ask myself, “Why do I want to do the startup?” This is a simple and most critical question for an entrepreneur. The why is the fuel when I need to work long hours to solve a difficult problem, the why is the compass guiding a company’s decision, and the why is the ultimate appeal for any right people to join the adventure. A right reason to start a company also makes decision and actions simpler. For instance, if I join a high-interest loan payment startup, I will find it difficult to get motivated and do my best, simply because I am not totally agree with why I am doing it.

## The joy to learn through highs and lows

Regardless the outcome of any startup, two things are guaranteed: first, we will fail; second, we will learn, a lot.
Business, at its core, is a complex human activity. The activity involves multiple people, who carry different objectives, experience, and opinions. The activity is also bind by many other factors such as political and economical climate, unprecedented natural events, etc. Taken all this into account, chances are slim that every business operation runs with outcomes as we expected (In fact, I feel lucky when things do go in our way). Inevitably there are highs and lows during a startup venture. If we shift our attitude from being troubled by every day challenges to an attitude of embracing challenges and treat each problem as a learning experience, our time is more enjoyable.

## The gratitude to be on a journey together

For the past few months I’ve been performing as a musical improviser at Chicago iO theatre on Monday nights. Performing on stage is a thrilling experience. I always feel the adrenaline rush of facing the limelight and showing my theatrical self to an audience. As improvisers, we take one suggestion from the audience and we constantly build stories and characters off each other. We act out some most eccentric characters and build some most unexpected stories right on the spot. We, and hopefully the audience, are so immersed in the art form that 30 minutes feel like a few seconds.

During my recent show, something magical happened. The routine started as usual: we warmed up our voices, played some improv games, and lined up behind the stage curtains ready for the real show. Right before we hit the stage, I looked at my fellow improvisers and tried to sync up with their excitement: Erika was doing some hippie 90s bud-shaking dance, BJ was walking like a dwarf with his neck stuck out, and Chris had some jazzy blue dance moves going on. While I was doing my regular chicken dance with inconsistent hand clapping, a strong sense of gratitude flooded inside. I realized how lucky I am to play with such a wonderful group, how lucky I am to share a moment of alternative reality with them, and how lucky I am to be on a journey of fun together with these crazy kids.

As we hit the stage, that sense of gratitude changed the way I perform. I completely focused on how to build great scenes by paying attention to the group. There is no sense of “me”, only the sense of “us”. That gratitude leads to a sense of group mind, and the sense of group mind leads to playfulness and amazing energy.
