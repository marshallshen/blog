# Introduction
[TODO]: Declare what the reader can get out of this blog post

### Lesson 1: Acting is about reacting. Improvising is about listening.

[TODO]: Acting is reacting

### Lesson 2: It's not about being funny, it's about stay true in the moment.

[TODO]: How to be in the moment

### Lesson 3: Energy is contagious. Positivity is contagious.

[TODO]: How the group have enormous positive impact on my life view.

### Lesson 4: Embrace change. Embrace the idea of having fun.

[TODO]: People who are willing to change are more likely to try improv. The group has people of different ages, but all of them show the willingness to change, the drive to learn things, and natural instinct to discover new things about themselves.

### Lesson 5: Love and Respect Your Audience.

[TODO]: In theatre, people pay time and money to see a show. It's actor's responsibility to show deep love and respect to the audience. In real world, life is your audience, and everyone around us is our audience, we should show love and respect to them the best we know how.

## Conclusion

[TODO] What's most important to me is this unexpected but amazing experience I've had for the past year. I'm amazed by strong friendship with people who I never thought I would meet, and I amazed by how much I've grown. I'm excited to experience more as I continue exploring improv.
