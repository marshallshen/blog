### The kid inside me
> May God bless and keep you always<br/>
> May your wishes all come true<br/>
> May you always do for others<br/>
> And let others do for you<br/>
> May you stay forever young<br/><br/>
> "Forever Young", Bob Dylan

There are a lot of memorable moments to reflect on in a lifetime. These moments shape who we are, reflect what we love, and show how we live.

We are all kids at heart. No matter how old we are, some parts of our nature remain hopeful, happy and curious. As kids, we play, we explore, we are captivated by the world around us.

There are some memorable moments in my life when I really felt the kid inside me; these moments shaped who I am.

#### May 7th, 2008, Hong Kong.

Travelers flooded into Hong Kong International Airport; many were excited about Beijing Olympics. Among the crowd, an eighteen-year-old was dragging his two big suitcases, trying to find his flight to America. His mother was with him, full of love and concern for her child. She kept reminding the kid to call her as soon as he arrived in Chicago.

The great artist Eminem famously raps about once in a lifetime opportunity:

> If you had one shot, one opportunity, <br/>
> to seize everything you wanted, in one moment, <br/>
> would you capture it, or let it slip?

The kid was determined. He knew that his mother spent her life saving to send him to America. He would do whatever it took to make it work.

The kid was hopeful. He loved the idea of American Dream and hoped to create a dream of his own.

The kid was romantic. He dreamt about one day to have a family he never had, to be a great man, a great husband, a great father.

The airplane to Chicago rose high into the sky. The kid looked outside the window trying to find his mother. He had tears in eyes. He had smiles on his face.

#### May 28th, 2012, Chicago.

Summer in Chicago can be very humid. The kid arrived at a factory looking building in River North, sweating because of the weather and excitement. It was his first day at his first job, a first step towards the real world, first time to apply what he learned to solve interesting problems.

The great American author Mark Twain once remarked on work and practice:

> The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.

The kid was motivated. As a software engineer, the kid found himself struggle with various technical and business problems. Every day the kid made small steps and small plans, believing that he can overcome various challenges.

The kid was disciplined. He realized that building a great product requires disciplines more than anything else. Sometimes business requirements were complex, sometimes operations went wrong unexpectedly. A good engineer must set out plans and execute plans to its fullest potential.

The kid was grateful, he felt lucky to have mentors and friends all around him. He felt lucky to learn their ways of perceiving problems, their discipline of solving problems. He appreciated those moments of laughs, frowns, and honest discussions about how to be better as a team.

Companies come and go, people come and go, but memories and friendship stay in the kid's heart, and forever he treasures it.

#### May 20th, 2015, New York City.

May is graduation season in America. On the upper west side of Manhattan, the energy of Columbia graduates was contagious. The Morningside campus is an ocean of blue - all Columbia graduates of 2015 gathered together, cheering, laughing, and hugging. Among the sea of the class of 2015, the kid danced and waved, cherishing the moment of celebration.

As the graduation ceremony came to an end, Jay Z's "Empire State of Mind" blasted out of the speaker, the beats and tone spread among the crowd, showing the love for the moment, the love for this great city:

> New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of, there is nothing you can't do. <br/>
> Count on you New York. These streets will make you feel brand new, the lights will inspire you.

The kid was thrilled, he believed that he could achieve more and greater things, that he could make this world a better place.

The kid was amazed, he remembered the moment of flying from Hong Kong to Chicago, and how much he changed.

The kid was optimistic, he was confident that if people strived to make an effort and do good, life would eventually smile at them.

Jay Z's song resonated around the campus; the kid wished he could remember this moment forever.

### The kid inside you
> May you grow up to be righteous<br/>
> May you grow up to be true<br/>
> May you always be courageous<br/>
> Stand upright and be strong<br/>
> May you stay forever young<br/><br/>
> "Forever Young", Bob Dylan

Life is a collection of moments. I hope you the best for your memorable moments, I hope you treasure them as much as I do, and I hope the kid inside you to be always cheerful.

I wish you stay forever young.
