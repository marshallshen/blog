Thanks for visiting my blog! I'm Marshall Shen. I intentinally keep this paragraph short because self introduction is really hard. Especially when your audience is behind an emotion-less computer screen.

As a starter, I will share with you some things I believe are true:

### Marshall Shen's truth list 2015 (Incomplete)

> When you are on a comedy staging improvsing, you are funny when you listen to your scene partner and simply have fun.

> Mayonnaise is evil - it's tasty but also a big troublemaker to your stomach.

> When you cook food for friends and family, you are happy, they are happy.

> Life is a collection of habits. The most important habits are about health, because health is the foundation of everything else.

> Meditate everyday - it connects body with mind. We are so much in our heads nowadays.

> Read everyday - the more you read, the more stuff you realize you don't know, it also reminds you how interesting the world is.

> Slow down is hard, be present is hard.

> Change is constant, great change comes incrementally.

> Experience is subjective, always strive to create best experience for you and your group.
